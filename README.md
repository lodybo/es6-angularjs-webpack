# ES6-AngularJS-Webpack experiment

After reading a bit about AngularJS styleguides, I wanted to try out a set up in which an Angular application was written in in ES6.
This project follows a set of rules from [Todd Motto's AngularJS Styleguide](https://github.com/toddmotto/angularjs-styleguide).

It's a very simple application in which we're retreiving a (random) user from our User Service.
Displaying the user will be done via an AngularJS component.
